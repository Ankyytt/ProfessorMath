# 🧮 ProfessorMath

**A MATLAB-inspired interpreted language for beginners — built in Java.**

ProfessorMath is a beginner-friendly, expression-oriented language designed for learning how programming languages, interpreters, and ASTs work. It supports arithmetic, variables, matrix operations, and includes both a REPL and a JavaFX GUI.

Whether you're a CS student, hobbyist, or aspiring compiler nerd — this project is for you!

## 📖 About

ProfessorMath is a lightweight interpreted language built to simulate core features of MATLAB and other mathematical scripting environments. Its goal is to help beginners understand how programming languages are parsed, interpreted, and executed — while enabling basic numerical and matrix computations.

---

## 📦 Features

- ✅ Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`
- ✅ Operator precedence and parentheses
- ✅ Variable assignments using `let`
- ✅ Built-in math functions: `sin`, `cos`, `log`, `sqrt`, etc.
- ✅ Matrix literals and operations
- ✅ Scalar-matrix operations
- ✅ `show` keyword for output display
- ✅ Command-line REPL
- ✅ JavaFX-powered GUI
- ✅ JSON-based expression serialization

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher
- JavaFX SDK (for running the GUI)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

> 💡 JavaFX must be properly configured in your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ or Eclipse).

---

### 📦 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/professormath.git
cd professormath

# Compile the source files
javac -d bin src/**/*.java
````

---

### 🧑‍💻 Running the REPL

```bash
java -cp bin repl.Repl
```

---

### 🖥️ Running the GUI

Make sure JavaFX is correctly set up in your IDE, then run:

```bash
# In your IDE, run:
gui/Main.java
```

---

## 💡 Usage Examples

```plaintext
# Variable arithmetic
let x = 5
let y = 3
x + y           => 8
(2 + 3) * 4 - 1 => 19

# Built-in functions
sin(0.5)        => 0.479...
log(10)         => 2.302...
sqrt(16)        => 4.0

# Matrix creation and math
let A = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
let B = [[5, 6], [7, 8]]
A + B           => [[6, 8], [10, 12]]
A * B           => Matrix multiplication
show A          => Prints matrix
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

Here’s a high-level view of how ProfessorMath works:

```
  Input → Lexer → Parser → AST → Evaluator → Output
                             ↓
                           (REPL or GUI)
```

### 🔍 Components

* **Lexer:** Tokenizes raw input.
* **Parser:** Builds the abstract syntax tree (AST).
* **AST Nodes:** Represent expressions like binary ops, function calls, variables, etc.
* **Evaluator:** Executes AST nodes and returns results.
* **REPL:** For command-line testing and debugging.
* **GUI:** A JavaFX-powered visual playground for input and output.
